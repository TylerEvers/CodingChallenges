# CodingChallenges
General repository consisting of all coding challenges, readme contains brief summarys of what each challenge entails


## Animal Actions
Date Completed: 2-10-2022

Animal Actions was part of a coding interview for a job.
The end goal was to write out descriptions of the four actions (Eat, Swim, Fly, Sound) for each animal (Parrot, Penguin, Pterodactyl, Duck)

The specific requirements can be found within the challenge folder however high level
1. Output of the functions descriptions to the console
2. AnimalActions must be declared as an internal static class

##Clock Angle
Date Completed: 12-14-2022

The Clock Angle problem was a question a friend encountered in an interview.
Given two integers, an hour and a minute, write a function to calculate the angle between the two hands on a clock representing that time.

TODO: In validating my work I realized there is another parameter I am currently not solving for, as the minute hand moves around the face of the clock the hour hand transitions to the next hour.
I need to revisit the problem to account for this change when calculating the angle as 12:30 would technically be closer to 165 instead of 180.
